The nexts steps are to test the data scraping functionality.

Things still needed for the prototype:
    <!-- 1. Finish and make sure data is scraped and returned correctly from Apify. -->
    <!-- 2. Send data to the ai and have it returned correctly.
        look at the other Repo for Hermes on how to do this correctly -->
    <!-- 3. Make sure that it is downloadable and formatted. -->
    <!-- 4. Make a Login page that is functional. -->
    <!-- 5. Update styling on everything
        1. Make the logo go away when the back bar is actie on the login page
        2. Styling of the form page.
        3. Add a how to use box for the dashboard page.
        4. Make the dashboard page look better. -->
    <!-- 6. Get the domain and connect it to vercel deployment. -->
    <!-- 7. Fix the AI prompt to return everything correctly. -->
    8. Update payment information on data scrapers so they do not stop working.
        Need to keep an eye on this.
    7. New data sources based on links or articles found.

Things for final production:
    1. Set up payment page and system using Stripe.
    2. Build out chat ai interface for user engagement.
    3. Have all scraped data get pushed to the database.
    4. Build page for user page for people to update their accounts.
    5. Finalize all of the pages:
        -footer
        -security pages
        -policy page
    6. Gameify the screen so it takes in different data sources in a fun slide pannel. UI should be like turbo tax card slides.
    7. Update prompt when we add all data points.

Future features
    1. Way to only input name and company of individual and the app funds the links for the user without having to do research



Information:

    For scraping data we use two places:
        Apify: https://console.apify.com
            Apify is used for Facebook and Instagram Scraping
            Facebook is currently not working so we will need to revise on this one

        Rapid API: https://rapidapi.com
            Rapid API is used for our Linkedin Scraping

At somepoint I need to make an actual ReadMe Page.
