# Project Roadmap

## Next Steps
**Need to Make actual sprint board for the final product. Probably in github projects**

## Tasks for Final Production
1. **Set Up Payment System**
   - Implement using [Stripe](https://stripe.com).
2. **Build Chat AI Interface**
   - Enhance user engagement.
3. **Push Scraped Data to Database**
   - Automate data transfer.
4. **Develop User Page**
   - Allow users to update their accounts.
5. **Finalize All Pages**
   - Footer
   - Security pages
   - Policy page
6. **Gamify the Interface**
   - Create a fun, slide-panel UI similar to TurboTax card slides.
7. **Update Prompt**
   - Reflect all data points.
8. **Update Payment Information**
   - Ensure data scrapers do not stop working.
   - Keep an eye on this regularly.
9. **Integrate New Data Sources**
   - Incorporate links or articles found.
10. **Error Handeling**
   - In app error handeling needs to be completed.
   - All api errors should send me a direct email when that happens.

## Future Features
1. **Simplified User Input**
   - Allow users to input only the name and company of an individual.
   - The app will find links for the user without requiring additional research.
